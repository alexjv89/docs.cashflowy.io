Original Google sheets docs can be found here - https://stripe.com/docs/api

Integration to Google sheets is done via service APIs. When your org is created with cashflowy, a google service email is also created for you. This passthough API can access any documents shared with this service email ID. 

All you need to do is share your document with the service email provided. The advantage for this method over Oauth is that when the service email makes update, you can see that in your version control. This makes easier to spot errors or tweets that you need to make to your scripts.
