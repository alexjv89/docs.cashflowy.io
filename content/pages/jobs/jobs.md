Every financial ops process consist of a set of jobs that needs to be performed. There are 2 types of jobs:
- maker
- checker

For any operation that is done, there is maker task and a checker task. Thats when you can assure quality for your operations. With Cashflowy platform APIs you can write maker jobs and checker jobs.
